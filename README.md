# NB-Core Modules

This repository provides optional modules for the [NB-Core/lotgd](https://github.com/NB-Core/lotgd) game engine. Most modules also work with DragonPrime LoTGD releases but are primarily maintained for NB-Core.

These modules extend nearly every aspect of the game ranging from administrative helpers to new forest events. Copy the desired PHP files (and folders if present) into your game's `modules/` directory and activate them from the game admin panel.

## Repository layout

Directories group modules by purpose:

- **pvp/** – player versus player extensions and events
- **administrative/** – tools for admins and moderation
- **forest/** – general forest related tweaks
- **forest_specials/** – additional forest encounters and bosses
- **inventory/** - inventory and items 
- **lodge/** – lodge upgrades
- **mounts/** – mount related features
- **systems/** – large feature systems (races, specialties etc.)
- **village_modules/** – village shops and activities
